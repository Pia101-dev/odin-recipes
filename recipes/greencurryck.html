    <h1>Green Curry Chicken</h1>
    <img src="../recipes/Thai-Green-Curry.png">
    <p>The name "green" curry derives 
        from the color of the dish, which comes from green chillies.
        As this is a Thai curry based on coconut milk and fresh green chillies, the color comes out creamy mild green or, 
        as this color is called in Thai, "sweet green".</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>coconut milk</li>
            <li>green curry paste</li>
            <li>palm sugar</li>
            <li>fish sauce</li>
            <li>aubergine</li>
            <li>basil leaves</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The paste is fried in split coconut cream until 
                the oil is expressed to release the aromas in the paste.</li>
            <li>Once the curry paste is cooked, more coconut milk and the 
                    remaining ingredients are added along with a pinch of 
                    palm sugar and fish sauce.</li>
            <li>Finally, as garnishes, Thai basil.</li>

        </ol>
